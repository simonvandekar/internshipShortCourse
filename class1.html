<li>It is a type of <em>selection bias</em> that can occur in biomedical research if participants with a particular exposure or characteristics are less likely to enroll in a study <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8624068/">Glesby and Hoover, 1996</a>.</li>

<p>‘Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No.&nbsp;1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No.&nbsp;3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No.&nbsp;2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?’</p>

<p>The LA Dodgers, Los Angeles’ resident baseball team, appeared on the cover of Sports Illustratedss August 28, 2017 issue following a run of tremendous form. They had won 71% of their games and were on pace to tie the record for the most wins in a season. The cover came with the caption “Best. Team. Ever?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The team then went on to lose 17 of their next 22 games, and would eventually lose in the World Series to the Houston Astros. This is just one example of the notorious Sports Illustrated cover jinx, an urban legend that apparently causes teams and athletes who appear on the cover to immediately experience a run of bad form.</p>

<li>The phenomenon is due to a combination of selection bias and the amount of randomness inherent in the measurements.</li>
<li>100 people flipping coins example (completely random).</li>
<li>100 people heights example (not very random).</li>
<li>In the baseball example, there are unpredictable factors affecting the teams performance and the team was selected on Sport’s Illustrated’s cover because of their unusually successful performance.</li>

<p><strong>Features of Biostatistics medical research</strong> * Improving health and understanding biological mechanisms * Prediction/diagnosis clinical translation (often with machine learning) * Collaboration on team with MDs, biologists, psychologists, epidemiologists, informaticians, etc. * Developing new statistical tools to address challenges in medical research!</p>
<p><strong>Biostatisticians’ role on the research team</strong> * It is easy to fit statistical or machine learning models to data and get results. * It is difficult to understand how study design or analysis procedures may bias the results. * Organizing study results in a sensible structure. * Biostatistics offers tools necessary to reason through and understand the analysis procedures.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-circularity-analysis">Example: Circularity analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Circularity analysis is a <strong>bad</strong> practice where the same data are used for variable selection and for prediction.</li>
<li>Circularity analysis remains a challenge in brain imaging studies <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2949251/">Kriegeskorte et al., 2010</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A circular analysis: * Let’s say I have measurements of brain activity across 100 brain regions and I want to know, which are associated with diagnosis (e.g.&nbsp;bipolar disorder) and to predict diagnosis using the brain imaging data * First, I fit a bunch of models to select important features</p>

<ul>
<li>Descriptive statistics are used to get an idea of what a dataset looks like</li>
<li>In research studies, they are frequently reported in a “Table 1”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commonly reported values are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sample size</em>, usually denoted <span class="math inline">n</span></li>
<li><em>Mean</em> <span class="math inline">\bar x = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i</span>. <em>Proportions</em> are also often reported, which is just the mean of a categorical variable.</li>
<li><em>Variance</em> <span class="math inline">s^2 = (n-1)^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2</span>.</li>
<li><em>Standard deviation</em> (SD) <span class="math inline">s = \sqrt{s^2}</span> (square root of the variance)</li>
<li><em>Median</em> is the middle value (or the average of the two middle values if <span class="math inline">n</span> is even. the 50% ordered value.</li>
<li><em>Quartiles</em>, the 25% ordered value and 75% ordered value. Some times call <em>Inter quartile range (IQR)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Types of variables</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Categorical variable - a variable that takes discrete values, such as diagnosis, sex,</li>
<li>Continuous variable - a variable that can take any values within a range, such as age, blood pressure, brain volume.</li>
<li>Ordinal variable - a categorical variable that can be ordered, such as age category, Likert scales, Number of days, Number of occurrences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Distribution/Density features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mode/ Non-modal/Unimodal/ Bimodal - a peak in a density.
<ul>
<li>Non-modal - no peak</li>
<li>Unimodal - one peak</li>
<li>Bimodal - two peaks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quantile - the <span class="math inline">p</span>th quantile, <span class="math inline">q_p</span> divides the distribution such that <span class="math inline">p</span>% of the data are below <span class="math inline">q_p</span>.
<ul>
<li>Median - 50th quantile of a distribution</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Skew/Skewness - the amount of asymmetry of a distribution
<ul>
<li>Symmetric distribution - a distribution with no skew</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Kurtosis - the heavy tailed-ness of a distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bivariate distribution features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Correlation/correlated - two variables are linearly dependent</li>
<li>Dependent - two or more variables are related to each other in some way</li>
<li>Independent - two variables that are not related to each other</li>
</ul>
